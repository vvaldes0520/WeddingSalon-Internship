# WeddingSalon-Internship
For Summer 2025, I got the opportunity to be a Computer Science Intern with WeddingSalon!

**Project 1: SEO and Google Analytics Research.**
- Learned all about SEO for websites, and gained access to WeddingSalon's Google Analytics. With my access I got to analyze all of the site's traffic and identified areas on their website for improvement based on these findings.

**Project 2: Figma Desktop Outline**
- Worked with the rest of the interns on completely new Desktop & Mobile website outlines for the site.
- Specialized on the Desktop outline, and designed a number of pages in Figma using UI/UX design priniciples, such as the Homepage, their showcases page, and their checout pages.

**Project 3: WordPress Site Application**
- Developed a new WordPress Wedding Salon site, translating the Figma designs into actual functional, user-friendly website pages.
- Contributed to a lot of the main pages, rest of site was handed to next set of interns.
